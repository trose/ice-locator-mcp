/**
 * Copy an Asset or Archive to a remote host.
 *
 * ## Example usage
 *
 * This example copies a local directory to a remote host via SSH. For brevity, the remote server is assumed to exist, but it could also be provisioned in the same Pulumi program.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import { remote, types } from "@pulumi/command";
 * import * as fs from "fs";
 * import * as os from "os";
 * import * as path from "path";
 *
 * export = async () => {
 *     const config = new pulumi.Config();
 *
 *     // Get the private key to connect to the server. If a key is
 *     // provided, use it, otherwise default to the standard id_rsa SSH key.
 *     const privateKeyBase64 = config.get("privateKeyBase64");
 *     const privateKey = privateKeyBase64 ?
 *         Buffer.from(privateKeyBase64, 'base64').toString('ascii') :
 *         fs.readFileSync(path.join(os.homedir(), ".ssh", "id_rsa")).toString("utf8");
 *
 *     const serverPublicIp = config.require("serverPublicIp");
 *     const userName = config.require("userName");
 *
 *     // The configuration of our SSH connection to the instance.
 *     const connection: types.input.remote.ConnectionArgs = {
 *         host: serverPublicIp,
 *         user: userName,
 *         privateKey: privateKey,
 *     };
 *
 *     // Set up source and target of the remote copy.
 *     const from = config.require("payload")!;
 *     const archive = new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(from);
 *     const to = config.require("destDir")!;
 *
 *     // Copy the files to the remote.
 *     const copy = new remote.CopyToRemote("copy", {
 *         connection,
 *         source: archive,
 *         remotePath: to,
 *     });
 *
 *     // Verify that the expected files were copied to the remote.
 *     // We want to run this after each copy, i.e., when something changed,
 *     // so we use the asset to be copied as a trigger.
 *     const find = new remote.Command("ls", {
 *         connection,
 *         create: `find ${to}/${from} | sort`,
 *         triggers: [archive],
 *     }, { dependsOn: copy });
 *
 *     return {
 *         remoteContents: find.stdout
 *     }
 * }
