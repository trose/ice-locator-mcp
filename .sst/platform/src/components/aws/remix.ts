   * - A path like `/docs`
   * - A subdomain like `docs.example.com`

   *
   * To serve your Remix app **from a subdomain**, you'll need to configure the

   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}
   * const router = new sst.aws.Router("Router", {

   *     instance: router,
   *     domain: "docs.example.com"

   *
   * Finally, to serve your Remix app **from a combined pattern** like
