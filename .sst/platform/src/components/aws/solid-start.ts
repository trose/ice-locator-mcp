   *
   * - A path like `/docs`
   * - A subdomain like `docs.example.com`
   * - Or a combined pattern like `dev.example.com/docs`
   *
   * @example
   *
   * To serve your SolidStart app **from a path**, you'll need to configure the root domain
   * in your `Router` component.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {2}
   * const router = new sst.aws.Router("Router", {
   *   domain: "example.com"

   *     instance: router,
   *     path: "/docs"
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * You also need to set the `baseURL` property in your `app.config.ts` without a
   * trailing slash.
   *
   * :::caution
   * If routing to a path, you need to set that as the base path in your
   * SolidStart app as well.
   * :::
   *
   * ```js title="app.config.ts" {3}
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   server: { preset: "aws-lambda" },
   *   baseURL: "/docs"
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * To serve your SolidStart app **from a subdomain**, you'll need to configure the
   * domain in your `Router` component to match both the root and the subdomain.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}
   * const router = new sst.aws.Router("Router", {
   *   domain: {
   *     name: "example.com",
   *     aliases: ["*.example.com"]
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Now set the `domain` in the `router` prop.
   *
   * ```ts {4}
   * {
   *   router: {
   *     instance: router,
   *     domain: "docs.example.com"
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Finally, to serve your SolidStart app **from a combined pattern** like
   * `dev.example.com/docs`, you'll need to configure the domain in your `Router` to
   * match the subdomain.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}

   *     domain: "dev.example.com",

 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.SolidStart("MyWeb");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Change the path

 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.SolidStart("MyWeb", {
 *   path: "my-solid-app/"

 *
 * #### Add a custom domain
 *

 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.SolidStart("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: "my-app.com"

 *
 * #### Redirect www to apex domain
 *

 *
 * ```js {4} title="sst.config.ts"

 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your app.
 *
 * ```ts {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.SolidStart("MyWeb", {
 *   link: [bucket]
 * });
 * ```
