## Heatmap Screenshot

To add a heatmap screenshot to the README:

1. Take a screenshot of the heatmap visualization from the web app
2. Save it as `heatmap-screenshot.png` in this directory
3. The README will automatically display it at the top of the file

The screenshot should show:
- The interactive map with facility markers
- Color-coded markers based on detainee counts
- The facility list panel on the left side
- A clean, professional view that demonstrates the visualization capabilities
