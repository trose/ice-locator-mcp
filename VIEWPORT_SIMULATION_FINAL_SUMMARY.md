### Key Features Implemented

- **Realistic Viewport Generation**: Generates realistic viewport dimensions with natural variations
- **Device-Specific Profiles**: Predefined viewport configurations for desktop, laptop, mobile, and tablet devices
- **Screen Property Spoofing**: Comprehensive screen property spoofing including width, height, color depth, etc.
- **Dynamic Viewport Resizing**: Capabilities for dynamic viewport resizing
- **Device Category Detection**: Automatic detection of device categories based on viewport properties
- **Integration with Playwright**: Seamless integration with Playwright browser contexts
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory and processing usage
- **Comprehensive API**: Full set of methods for viewport management operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging

### API Methods Provided

1. `get_random_viewport()` - Get a random viewport configuration based on device type
2. `get_random_device_profile()` - Get a random device profile with realistic properties
3. `generate_realistic_viewport()` - Generate a completely realistic viewport with natural variations
4. `apply_viewport_to_context()` - Apply viewport and screen properties to a browser context
5. `get_viewport_dimensions()` - Get viewport dimensions as a tuple
6. `get_screen_dimensions()` - Get screen dimensions as a tuple
7. `is_mobile_viewport()` - Check if viewport is mobile-sized
8. `is_tablet_viewport()` - Check if viewport is tablet-sized
9. `get_device_category()` - Get device category based on viewport properties

### Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Viewport profile operations (creation, serialization, etc.)
- ✅ Device profile operations
- ✅ Random viewport generation by device type
- ✅ Realistic viewport generation
- ✅ Device profile selection
- ✅ Viewport dimension calculations
- ✅ Mobile and tablet viewport detection
- ✅ Device category detection

### Integration Points

The ViewportManager seamlessly integrates with:
- BrowserSimulator for viewport simulation
- AntiDetectionCoordinator for overall anti-detection strategy

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Realism**: Browser appears more realistic with proper viewport and screen properties, reducing detection risk
2. **Enhanced Evasion**: Viewport simulation helps avoid detection by anti-bot systems that look for realistic display characteristics
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Efficient implementation optimizes browser resources while ensuring data integrity
4. **Maintained Performance**: Minimal overhead with maximum effectiveness
