# Timezone and Locale Simulation Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the TimezoneLocaleManager module, which provides advanced timezone and locale simulation capabilities to avoid detection based on geographic inconsistencies in the ICE Locator MCP Server.

The TimezoneLocaleManager class is the core component that handles timezone and locale simulation. It includes:

1. **Realistic Timezone Simulation**
   - Timezone ID spoofing with realistic values
   - Timezone offset management
   - Geolocation coordinate spoofing
   - Consistent timezone and geolocation mapping

2. **Locale Simulation**
   - Locale string spoofing with realistic values
   - Language and country code management
   - Currency and numbering system spoofing
   - Text direction handling (LTR/RTL)

3. **Profile Management**
   - Random timezone and locale profile generation
   - Realistic profile combination with consistency checking
   - Profile serialization and deserialization

4. **Browser Integration**
   - JavaScript code generation for timezone/locale spoofing
   - Playwright browser context integration
   - Dynamic profile application
   - HTTP header customization

### Data Classes

Two data classes were created to represent timezone and locale configurations:

1. **TimezoneProfile**
   - Represents a timezone configuration with realistic properties
   - Includes timezone ID, offset, locale, language, country code, and geolocation
   - Provides serialization methods (to_dict, from_dict)

2. **LocaleProfile**
   - Represents a locale configuration with realistic properties
   - Includes locale, language, country code, currency, numbering system, calendar, and text direction
   - Provides serialization methods (to_dict, from_dict)

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Timezone Spoofing**
   - Realistic timezone ID selection from major global cities
   - Accurate timezone offset calculation
   - Consistent geolocation coordinates for each timezone
   - JavaScript injection for Intl.DateTimeFormat spoofing

2. **Locale Spoofing**
   - Realistic locale selection from major world languages
   - Consistent language, currency, and numbering system mapping
   - Text direction handling for LTR and RTL languages
   - HTTP header customization for different locales

3. **Profile Management**
   - Random profile selection for varied fingerprinting
   - Realistic profile generation with natural combinations
   - Consistency checking between timezone and locale profiles
   - Profile serialization for storage and transmission

4. **Browser Context Integration**
   - Seamless integration with Playwright browser contexts
   - Dynamic JavaScript injection for property spoofing
   - HTTP header customization for realistic requests
   - Profile application before page creation

## Technical Approach

### Timezone Simulation

The timezone simulation approach includes:

1. **Timezone ID Spoofing**
   - Selection from realistic timezone IDs for major global cities
   - Consistent mapping between timezone IDs and offsets
   - Geolocation coordinate mapping for each timezone

2. **JavaScript Injection**
   - Override of Intl.DateTimeFormat to spoof timezone
   - Override of Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset for accurate offset reporting
   - Override of toLocaleString methods for timezone-consistent formatting
   - Performance.timeOrigin adjustment for timezone consistency

3. **Geolocation Consistency**
   - Realistic latitude and longitude coordinates for each timezone
   - Consistent mapping between timezone IDs and geolocation data

### Locale Simulation

The locale simulation approach includes:

1. **Locale String Spoofing**
   - Selection from realistic locale strings for major world languages
   - Consistent mapping between locales and language properties
   - Currency and numbering system mapping for each locale

2. **HTTP Header Customization**
   - Accept-Language headers that match the locale
   - Accept-Charset headers appropriate for the language
   - Other headers that vary by locale for realistic simulation

3. **JavaScript Injection**
   - Override of navigator.language and navigator.languages
   - Override of toLocaleString methods for locale-consistent formatting

### Profile Consistency

The profile consistency approach includes:

1. **Matching Profiles**
   - Direct matching between timezone locale and locale profile
   - Language matching when exact locale match is not available
   - Compatible combination checking for related locales

2. **Validation**
   - Consistency checking between timezone and locale profiles
   - Validation of profile properties for realistic values
   - Compatibility checking for related locale combinations

## Integration Points

### Browser Simulator Integration

The TimezoneLocaleManager integrates with the BrowserSimulator to provide realistic timezone and locale simulation:

1. **Context Application**
   - Automatic application of timezone and locale profiles to browser contexts
   - Dynamic profile generation for each session
   - JavaScript injection for property spoofing
   - HTTP header customization for realistic requests

2. **Profile Management**
   - Random profile selection for varied fingerprinting
   - Realistic profile generation for natural appearance
   - Consistency checking to ensure valid configurations
