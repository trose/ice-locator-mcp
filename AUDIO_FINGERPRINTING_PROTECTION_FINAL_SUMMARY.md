- Efficient JavaScript code generation
- Lightweight profile objects

## Security Benefits

- Prevents audio-based browser fingerprinting
- Blocks oscillator and analyser fingerprinting techniques
- Protects against frequency data analysis
- Provides realistic audio characteristics for different device types
- Makes fingerprinting-based tracking ineffective

## Next Steps

1. Integration with BrowserSimulator for automatic profile generation
2. Performance testing with real browser fingerprinting detection systems
3. Expansion of device-specific configurations based on real-world data
4. Implementation of additional audio fingerprinting protection techniques
5. Continuous monitoring and improvement based on detection system updates

## Conclusion

The AudioFingerprintingProtectionManager successfully implements advanced protection against audio-based browser fingerprinting techniques. It provides realistic spoofing of AudioContext properties and methods, preventing detection through audio fingerprinting while maintaining compatibility with legitimate web applications.
