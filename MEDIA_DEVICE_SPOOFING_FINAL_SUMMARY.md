- MediaDeviceProfile creation and methods
- Random profile generation with realistic values
- Device-specific profile generation
- Fingerprint generation consistency
- Profile consistency validation
- JavaScript code generation

## Performance Considerations

- Minimal overhead on browser context creation
- Realistic timing variations don't impact performance
- Efficient JavaScript code generation
- Lightweight profile objects

## Security Benefits

- Prevents media device-based browser fingerprinting
- Blocks media device enumeration techniques
- Protects against actual device access
- Provides realistic media device characteristics for different device types
- Makes fingerprinting-based tracking ineffective

## Next Steps

1. Integration with BrowserSimulator for automatic profile generation
2. Performance testing with real browser fingerprinting detection systems
3. Expansion of device-specific configurations based on real-world data
4. Implementation of additional media device spoofing techniques
5. Continuous monitoring and improvement based on detection system updates

## Conclusion

The MediaDeviceSpoofingManager successfully implements advanced spoofing of media device information to prevent browser fingerprinting based on media device enumeration. It provides realistic spoofing of audio and video device information, preventing websites from accessing real media devices while maintaining realistic API behavior and compatibility with legitimate web applications.
