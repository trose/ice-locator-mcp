## Key Integration Points

1. **API Contract** - Defined by TASK-M004 deliverables
2. **Database Schema** - Defined by TASK-M002 deliverables
3. **Infrastructure Requirements** - Defined by TASK-M003 deliverables
4. **Mobile State Management** - Coordinated between Mobile and Backend teams

## Daily Standup Focus

### Week 1
- Mobile: Environment setup, project structure
- Backend: FastAPI setup, database models
- DevOps: Terraform configuration, AWS resources

### Week 2
- Mobile: Search form implementation, API integration
- Backend: Notification service logic, SMS/email integration
- DevOps: Docker containers, deployment pipelines

### Week 3
- Mobile: Notification setup, saved searches
- Backend: Testing, security validation
- QA: Test suite development, integration testing

### Week 4
- All teams: Bug fixes, documentation, release preparation

## Success Criteria

1. **Mobile App**: Search and notification features working on iOS and Android
2. **Backend**: API gateway and notification service fully functional
3. **Infrastructure**: Deployed and monitored in AWS
4. **Quality**: >85% test coverage, security validated
5. **Documentation**: Complete user and technical documentation
6. **Release**: Production deployment ready, app store submission prepared

## Risk Indicators

ðŸ”´ **High Risk**: App store approval delays (TASK-M018)
ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk**: SMS/email delivery issues (TASK-M008)
ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk**: Documentation completeness (TASK-M014-016)

Monitor these daily and escalate if needed.
