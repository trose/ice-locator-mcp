# Mobile App Feature Branch Setup for ICE Locator

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a simplified design and implementation plan for a mobile application that enables users to search for ICE detainees by name. The mobile app will directly integrate with the existing ICE Locator MCP server to perform searches, eliminating complex backend infrastructure.

### Key Features
- Search for detainees by name, date of birth, and country of birth
- Display search results directly from ICE database
- Simple, privacy-first approach with no data storage

### Simplified Technical Approach
- Direct MCP integration from React Native mobile app
- No backend services or infrastructure needed
- No notification system (simplified scope)
- No complex deployment requirements

## 2. Simplified System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

    D[Monitoring] --> B
```

### Component Description
1. **Mobile App**: React Native cross-platform application for iOS and Android
2. **MCP Server**: Existing ICE Locator MCP server for search operations
3. **Monitoring**: Existing MCPcat integration for system monitoring

## 3. Mobile Application Design

### Component Architecture

    B --> C[Search Form]
    B --> D[Search Results]
```

### Core Components
1. **Search Screen**
   - Form for entering detainee name, date of birth, country of birth
   - Submit button to trigger search via MCP server
   - Display of search results with detainee information

### State Management
- Local component state only (no Redux)
- AsyncStorage for minimal local caching (optional)

## 4. Simplified Approach

### Direct MCP Integration
- Mobile app connects directly to MCP server
- No intermediate API gateway needed
- No database required
- No notification service needed

### Minimal Infrastructure
- No Terraform or AWS infrastructure
- No Docker containers
- No complex deployment pipeline
- Simple mobile app distribution

## 5. Data Models

### Search Request
``json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-15",
  "country_of_birth": "Mexico"
}
```

### Search Result
``json
{
  "detainee_id": "A123456789",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-15",
  "country_of_birth": "Mexico",
  "location": "Los Angeles, CA",
  "status": "Detained",
  "booking_date": "2023-01-01"
}
```

## 6. Simplified Development Approach

### Mobile App Only
- Focus solely on React Native mobile app development
- Direct integration with existing MCP server
- No backend services to implement
- No infrastructure to deploy

### Reduced Team Requirements
- Only need mobile app developer
- No backend developer required
- No DevOps engineer required
- Simplified testing approach

## 7. Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- No personal data stored on device
- TLS encryption for all data in transit
- Automatic redaction of PII in logs (handled by MCP server)

### Privacy Compliance
- GDPR compliant by design (no data storage)
- CCPA compliant by design (no data storage)
- No persistent storage of search data
- No user tracking

## 8. Simplified Testing Strategy

### Mobile Testing
- Unit tests for React Native components
- Integration tests with MCP server
- Manual testing on iOS and Android devices

## 9. Simplified Deployment Plan

### Mobile App Deployment
1. Build iOS and Android applications
2. Test on physical devices
3. Distribute via standard channels (no app store submission required initially)

## 10. Simplified Timeline and Milestones

### Phase 1: Mobile App Development (Week 1)
- Set up React Native project
- Implement search form
- Integrate with MCP server
- Display search results

### Phase 2: Testing and Polish (Week 2)
- Test on iOS and Android devices
- Fix bugs and optimize performance
- Prepare for distribution

## 11. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- ICE website changes breaking the search functionality
- Network connectivity issues on mobile devices

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement robust error handling and fallbacks
- Test on various network conditions
