# Fix for 403 Errors - Browser-Based Anti-Detection Implementation

## Overview

This implementation addresses the 403 Forbidden errors encountered when accessing the ICE Online Detainee Locator System by implementing a more sophisticated, browser-based anti-detection system using Playwright.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Updates

- Added Playwright (`playwright>=1.40.0`) to `pyproject.toml`
- Installed Playwright browser binaries (Chromium)

### 2. New Browser Simulator Module

Created `src/ice_locator_mcp/anti_detection/browser_simulator.py` with:

- **Playwright Integration**: Uses real Chromium browser engine for maximum realism
- **Human-Like Behavior**: Simulates realistic typing, mouse movements, and page interactions
- **Browser Fingerprinting Evasion**: Advanced techniques to avoid detection
- **Form Handling**: Realistic form filling with human-like delays
- **Navigation**: Natural page navigation with reading simulation

### 3. Browser Fingerprinting Evasion

Created `src/ice_locator_mcp/anti_detection/js/stealth.js` with comprehensive evasion techniques:

- WebDriver property removal
- Chrome object mocking
- Permission API spoofing
- Plugin and MIME type simulation
- Memory and performance API mocking
- Canvas and WebGL fingerprinting prevention
- Geolocation and other API spoofing

### 4. Search Engine Integration

Updated `src/ice_locator_mcp/core/search_engine.py` to:

- Detect 403 errors automatically
- Fall back to browser-based simulation when 403 errors occur
- Retry searches using the browser simulator
- Handle both name-based and A-number searches with browser simulation

### 5. Anti-Detection Coordinator Integration

Updated `src/ice_locator_mcp/anti_detection/coordinator.py` to:

- Integrate browser simulator as a core component
- Coordinate between all anti-detection strategies
- Provide unified interface for browser-based requests
- Handle session management for browser instances

### 6. Documentation Updates

- Updated `README.md` to document browser-based anti-detection features
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` to record the new version and features

## How It Works

1. **Normal Operation**: The system attempts searches using the standard HTTP client
2. **403 Detection**: When a 403 Forbidden error is encountered, the system automatically switches to browser simulation
3. **Browser Simulation**: Playwright launches a real browser instance with evasion techniques
4. **Human-Like Behavior**: The browser simulates realistic human interactions with the website
5. **Result Processing**: Search results are extracted and processed as normal

## Benefits

- **Improved Success Rate**: Browser-based requests are much less likely to be blocked
- **Realistic Behavior**: Human-like interactions reduce detection risk
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamless transition from HTTP to browser when needed
- **Enhanced Evasion**: Comprehensive fingerprinting evasion techniques
- **Maintained Performance**: Browser simulation only used when necessary

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify:

- Browser simulator functionality
- 403 error handling and fallback
- Integration with existing anti-detection components

## Configuration

The browser-based anti-detection is enabled by default and can be controlled through the configuration:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "behavioral_simulation": true
  }
}
```

## Future Improvements

- Add support for additional browser engines (Firefox, WebKit)
- Implement more sophisticated CAPTCHA handling
- Add proxy support for browser instances
- Enhance behavioral simulation with more realistic patterns
