# Fortified Browser Approach Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the specific tasks for implementing the fortified headless browser approach to bypass Akamai Bot Manager and improve the ICE website scraping reliability.

## Task List

### 1. TLS Fingerprint Randomization
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Implement JA3 fingerprint resistance to avoid detection based on SSL/TLS characteristics
**Subtasks**:
- Research and implement TLS fingerprint randomization techniques
- Integrate with existing HTTP client infrastructure
- Test effectiveness against Akamai detection

### 2. Advanced Browser Fingerprinting Evasion
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Go beyond basic stealth.js techniques to implement WebGL and canvas fingerprinting protection
**Subtasks**:
- Implement WebGL and canvas fingerprinting protection
- Mask hardware concurrency and platform information
- Spoof device memory and CPU class information
- Test fingerprint uniqueness

### 3. Residential Proxy Integration
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Use high-quality residential or mobile proxies instead of datacenter IPs
**Subtasks**:
- Integrate with residential proxy providers
- Implement automatic rotation and IP reputation checking
- Add quality scoring systems for proxy validation
- Test IP reputation and success rates

### 4. Behavioral Analysis Evasion
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Implement realistic human-like interaction patterns
**Subtasks**:
- Add natural timing variations between actions
- Simulate realistic mouse movements and scrolling patterns
- Mimic human reading and decision-making behaviors
- Test behavior pattern detection

### 5. JavaScript Execution Simulation
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Improve timing control for JavaScript execution
**Subtasks**:
- Handle complex client-side challenges
- Simulate realistic execution patterns and delays
- Test JavaScript challenge handling

### 6. Request Pattern Obfuscation
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Randomize request timing and sequences
**Subtasks**:
- Implement header order randomization
- Vary accept-language and other headers naturally
- Avoid predictable request patterns
- Test pattern detection avoidance

## Implementation Priority

Based on effectiveness against Akamai Bot Manager:

1. **TLS Fingerprint Randomization** - Addresses detection at the connection level
2. **Residential Proxy Integration** - Improves IP reputation and geographic consistency
3. **Advanced Browser Fingerprinting** - Handles JavaScript-based detection
4. **Behavioral Analysis Evasion** - Addresses AI-based behavior analysis
5. **Request Pattern Obfuscation** - Prevents detection based on request sequences

## Success Metrics

- Increase success rate against ICE website from current level to 85-95%
- Reduce 403 Forbidden errors by 80%
- Maintain acceptable performance (response time < 30 seconds)
- Ensure compatibility with existing MCP server functionality
