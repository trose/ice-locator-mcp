# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

The ICE Locator MCP Server implements several security measures:

### Anti-Detection Security
- **Proxy rotation** with health monitoring
- **Request obfuscation** to prevent fingerprinting
- **Behavioral simulation** for human-like patterns
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### Data Security
- **No persistent storage** of sensitive data
- **Local-only caching** with automatic expiration
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Error handling** without information disclosure

### Network Security
- **TLS/SSL enforcement** for all connections
- **Certificate validation** for proxy connections
- **Timeout handling** to prevent hanging connections
- **Request retry limits** to prevent infinite loops

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT open a public issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report privately

Send a detailed report to: **security@ice-locator-mcp.org**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)

### 3. Response timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed investigation results
- **30 days**: Fix implementation and release

### 4. Responsible disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will work with you to understand the issue
- We will keep you informed of our progress
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability until we have released a fix

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Keep software updated** to the latest version
- **Use secure proxy services** if proxy functionality is enabled
- **Monitor logs** for unusual activity
- **Follow rate limiting guidelines** to avoid detection
- **Use strong authentication** for any custom configurations

### For Developers
- **Validate all inputs** thoroughly
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent injection
- **Handle errors gracefully** without revealing sensitive information
- **Follow secure coding practices** outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Run security tests** before submitting pull requests

## Known Security Considerations

### Anti-Detection Measures
This software implements anti-detection measures including:
- IP rotation through proxy services
- Request timing obfuscation
- User-agent rotation
- Behavioral simulation

**Important**: These measures are designed solely to prevent automated blocking and should be used responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws.

### Legal Compliance
- Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with local laws
- The software is designed for legitimate use cases only
- Anti-detection measures must not be used for malicious purposes
- Rate limiting helps prevent abuse of target systems

### Data Privacy
- No personal information is permanently stored
- All caching is local and temporary
- Network requests are made directly from user's system
- No data is transmitted to third-party services (except configured proxies)

## Threat Model

### In Scope
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Configuration security issues

### Out of Scope
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Issues in dependencies (report to respective maintainers)
- Issues requiring physical access to the system
- Network infrastructure attacks

## Security Tools and Testing

We use the following tools for security testing:
- **bandit**: Python security linter
- **safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **pytest**: Security-focused unit tests
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated dependency scanning

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate response** (within 1 hour)
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Implement temporary mitigations if possible
   - Notify key stakeholders

2. **Short-term response** (within 24 hours)
   - Develop and test fix
   - Prepare security advisory
   - Coordinate with reporters

3. **Long-term response** (within 7 days)
   - Release patched version
   - Publish security advisory
   - Update security documentation
   - Review and improve security practices
