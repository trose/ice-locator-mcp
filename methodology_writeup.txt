A Method for Estimating Recent Populations at ICE Detention Facilities

Executive Summary
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) regularly releases data on two key data points
associated with immigrant detention: (1) the total number of immigrants currently in detention
nationwide and (2) the average daily population (ADP) of individual detention facilities over
the fiscal year to date (FYTD). ICE does not provide up-to-date data on the total currently
detained population at individual detention facilities — an important yet missing data point.
In this paper, Relevant Research outlines a method for estimating the recent daily average
populations at individual detention facilities for the time interval between ICE’s previous
detention spreadsheet and the current detention spreadsheet. W e refer to ICE’s facility-level
ADP estimates as “Reported ADP” and we refer to our facility-level ADP estimates as “Interval
ADP” . As we show in this paper, sudden spikes or dips in ICE’s detained population at specific
facilities may result in significant differences between Reported ADP and Interval ADP . Thus,
Interval ADP provides facility-level estimates that are closer to current reality than ICE’s
Reported ADP .
Understanding ICE’s Immigrant Detention Data: T otal Detained
Population and Average Daily Population (ADP)
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) releases immigrant detention data in an Excel
spreadsheet about every two weeks as required by Congress. The spreadsheet is available
online at https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management (URL is subject to change). The
detention spreadsheet provides the most up-to-date data on ICE’s detained population, as well
1
as data on ICE’s Alternatives to Detention (A TD) program and ICE removals, thus making
it an invaluable source of public information.
ICE’s detention spreadsheet provides two distinct yet overlapping sources of data on ICE’s
detained population.
First, the ICE detention spreadsheet reports the total number of people in detention at a
given point in time (aka “snapshot data”) on the spreadsheet tab currently named “Detention
FY25” . ICE’s detention snapshot data is nationwide only and does not provide the current
actually detained population at individual facilities as of each reporting date. The reporting
date is documented in the “F ootnotes” tab of ICE’s detention spreadsheet as the day that the
ICE National Docket data were current in the Enforcement Integrated Database (EID). The
method below does not use this data point in the analysis.
Second, the ICE detention spreadsheet reports the average daily population (ADP) for each
facility in use at the time of reporting under the spreadsheet tab currently named “F acilities
FY25” . This data provides fiscal-year-to-date averages, but does not provide the current
actually detained population at individual facilities as of each reporting date. The reporting
date, which will be used in the calculations below, is documented in the “F acilities FY25” tab
above the table. ICE’s facility-level Reported ADP is the subject of this paper.
Calculating Reported ADP
ICE reports facility-level data using an average daily population (ADP) based on an un-
weighted cumulative average starting at the beginning of every fiscal year (October 1) and
ending with the reporting date.
ICE’s description of the ADP calculation in the footnotes of its detention spreadsheet is as
follows:
“The A verage Daily Population (ADP) is based on MANDA Y Count. A MANDA Y
is based on whether a SUBJECT is in an ERO detention facility for the midnight
count. F or every SUBJECT in a facility for the midnight count, that corresponds
to one MANDA Y. The ADP is the number of MANDA YS for a given time period,
divided by the number of days in that time period. ”
The following example illustrates ICE’s calculation. Suppose the following scenario at a given
facility: 10 people are in detention at midnight on October 1, 12 on October 2, and 15 on
October 3. The ADP would be calculated as 10 + 12 + 15, a total of 37 MANDA YS, divided
by three (3) days, for an ADP of 12.3.1
1ICE does not list the facility-by-facility total ADP in its detention spreadsheet, instead choosing to disaggre-
gate detention counts by “threat level”, “male/female”, and “criminality” . W e determine the total reported
ADP by facility by summing the various fields in the same category .
2
The cumulative average (CA) method that underlies ICE’s ADP calculation can be generalized
as follows, with the xrepresenting the number of detainees at a facility at midnight (“one
detention day” or one “MANDA Y”) and nrepresenting the total number of days from the
start of the fiscal year on October 1 to the reporting date in the detention spreadsheet.
𝐶 𝐴𝑛=𝑥1+ 𝑥2+ ⋯ + 𝑥𝑛
𝑛
ICE’s detention spreadsheet supplies the ADP in each data release and the reporting date.
When combined, these two values allow us to derive the cumulative number of detention days
(i.e., MANDA YS) over the fiscal year as:
𝐶 𝐴𝑛⋅ 𝑛 = 𝑥1+ 𝑥2+ ⋯ + 𝑥𝑛
In plain language, this can be described as:
𝐴𝐷𝑃 =Cumulative Detention Days
T otal Reporting Days
and:
𝐴𝐷𝑃 ⋅ T otal Reporting Days = Cumulative Detention Days
Disadvantage of ICE’S Reported ADP
While ICE’s Reported ADP may be useful for the agency , it suffers from severe shortcomings
when considered from the perspective of the public, who has an interest in understanding what
is happening currently at individual detention facilities.
As a result of ICE’s method of calculating ADP , the facility-level ADP numbers released by
ICE may diverge considerably from reality . The total currently detained population of any
individual facility may be higher or lower than the average daily population over the current
fiscal year. This divergence is especially true when numbers spike or dip suddenly , since it
will take time for sudden recent changes in a facility’s real population to be reflected in the
facility’s Reported ADP .
F urthermore, the “smoothing” effect of ICE’s ADP calculation becomes increasingly pro-
nounced over the duration of the fiscal year, so that sudden changes later in the fiscal year
will take longer to register than sudden changes earlier in the fiscal year. Significant changes
in a given facility’s detained population in November or December would be noticeable more
quickly than significant changes in that same facility’s detained population in July or August.

W e emphasize that ICE’s method of calculating ADP is not a recent creation of the current
administration, but has been used since ICE started producing detention data in the present
format during the first T rump administration.
A Halfway Solution: Interval ADP
Despite the disadvantages of ICE’s Reported ADP outlined above, ICE’s detention data spread-
sheet provides suﬀicient information for estimating the recent average daily population at any
given facility using simple algebra. This is possible by comparing the change in average daily
population between two reporting dates and comparing that to the total days between report-
ing dates.
Instead of using a cumulative approach to ADP over a fiscal year, we calculate the ADP for
the interval between ICE data releases. T o put it simply , this method answers the question:
“What must the average daily population have been over the recent reporting period (typically
14 days) for the FYTD ADP to have fluctuated from the previous reported value to the current
value?”
Although this calculation does not answer the basic question of how many people are held in
each facility at a given time, a data point that would be more consistent with ICE’s reporting
for its total nationwide detained population, our calculation does provide a simple and defen-
sible approach to estimating recent ADP at individual facilities over a more restricted time
period.
This “Interval A verage” can be represented by:
𝐼 𝐴𝑛=(𝑥1+ 𝑥2+ ⋯ + 𝑥𝑛)1− (𝑥1+ 𝑥2+ ⋯ + 𝑥𝑛)2
𝑛1− 𝑛2
With xas the number of detainees at a facility at midnight (“one detention day”) within the
interval and nas the number of days since the last data release by ICE . In plain language, this
can be described as:
Interval ADP =Cumulative Detainees Held Since Last Release
Days Since Previous Release
Unlike the cumulative average used by ICE, the Interval ADP presented here is based on a
simple moving average (specifically a backward moving average), which has the advantage
of highlighting recent changes in population. Whereas ICE’s reporting method smooths out
facility increase or decrease that occur later in a given fiscal year, the Interval ADP method
shows recent facility-level population estimates regardless of whether the change occurs in
December or July .

Interval ADP Case Study: Adams County Detention Center
W e now apply this method to a real case study of Adams County Detention Center, a facility
with one of the largest detained populations in the country . As of March 17, 2025, ICE reported
that Adams County Detention Center in Natchez, Mississippi, had a (rounded) ADP of 2,154
detainees.
First, let us apply the “Reported ADP” calculation to determine the number of cumulative
detention nights on March 17, the 168th day in the fiscal year:
2, 154 ADP =𝑥1+ 𝑥2+ ⋯ + 𝑥𝑛
168 days in the fiscal year
W e can determine that the number of cumulative detention days as of March 17 is:
2, 154 ⋅ 168 = 361, 872 detention days
In the subsequent detention spreadsheet, ICE reported that on March 31, 2025 — two weeks
later — Adams County Detention Center had an (again, rounded) ADP of 2,161 detainees.
Using the above calculation, we find that there were a total of 393,302 detention nights as of
that date.
W e now have two cumulative detention night estimates and the number of days between the
two dates: 14 days. W e insert these values into the formula as follows:
𝐼 𝐴𝑛=393, 302 − 361, 872
14=31, 430
14= 2, 245 Interval ADP
Finding the difference between the “Reported ADP” from ICE and the “Interval ADP” devel-
oped here, we can determine the divergence of ICE’s Reported ADP compared to the Interval
ADP:
2, 245 Interval ADP − 2, 161 Reported ADP = 84 more detainees than reported
T o summarize, the Interval ADP shows that between March 17, 2025, and March 31, 2025,
Adams County Detention Center had an ADP of 2,245 detainees. The Interval ADP for this
period is 84 detainees per day higher than reported by ICE.

Assessing the Interval ADP Method
The Interval ADP method has a distinct advantage over the ICE Reported ADP estimates: it
provides more accurate recent estimates of the detained population at any given facility . In
general, anyone seeking the most recent estimate of the detained population at a given facility
will be well-served by applying this method.
This method requires some prerequisite knowledge and skills. W e note that ICE does not
maintain a public historical archive of its detention spreadsheets. However, the public may
use the Internet Archive’s W ayback Machine and the URL provided above to find older spread-
sheets. W e also warn against using ICE’s facilities data without proper validation first. ICE’s
detention spreadsheet routinely contains obvious and unobvious errors that may corrupt the
calculations described in this paper — unless those errors are identified first. (It is beyond the
scope of this paper to describe the various validation techniques we use for this dataset.)
The Interval ADP method, although useful, leaves important questions unanswered. Like any
average daily population estimate, it still does not answer the question of how many people
are in a given facility at a single point in time. The method is also agnostic as to the forces
that determine increases and decreases in facility population; we cannot determine the full
range of factors the drive population number up or down at a given facility .
The method is also not the only way to calculate a moving average for ADP . The backward
moving average shown here provides immediate estimations of current facility detainee popu-
lations. However, a center moving average, one which calculates changes at an historical point
in time using data forward and backward, may be preferable for certain projects, although
it would not provide immediate estimates at the time of each of ICE’s detention spreadsheet
releases.
Despite the limitations of the method proposed in this paper, we believe that most people
will find the Interval ADP calculation to be significantly more relevant than ICE’s Reported
ADP .
