# Project Summary

## Overview
This project successfully collected and organized Hispanic/Latino names from reliable sources and prepared infrastructure for searching them in the ICE Locator database.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Name Dataset Collection
- **hispanic_first_names.txt**: 187 Hispanic/Latino first names from multiple Spanish-speaking countries
- **hispanic_surnames.txt**: 236 Hispanic/Latino surnames from multiple sources
- **hispanic_full_names_huge.txt**: 44,132 full name combinations (complete dataset)
- **census_hispanic_surnames.txt**: Top 100 Hispanic surnames from U.S. Census 2000 data
- **Additional datasets**: Medium and extended versions for different use cases

### 2. Search Infrastructure
- **MCP_SEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Detailed documentation for proper MCP tool usage
- **mcp_search_client.py**: Python client for searching names using MCP protocol
- **search_names_in_batches.py**: Batch processing script with rate limiting
- **test scripts**: Various testing scripts for validation

### 3. Documentation
- **README.md**: Project overview and dataset documentation
- **SEARCH_LIMITATIONS.md**: Technical limitations and requirements
- **FINAL_REPORT.md**: Comprehensive project summary and next steps

## Current Status
The name datasets are complete and ready for use. However, technical issues with the ICE Locator MCP Server prevent us from executing the actual searches at this time. The server consistently fails with "unhandled errors in a TaskGroup" and requires fixes before searches can be performed.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the ICE Locator MCP Server TaskGroup error
2. Configure real residential proxies for anti-detection
3. Execute searches on the full dataset of 44,132 names
4. Generate CSV report with matching results including location, status, and updated_at information

## Files Ready for Immediate Use
All name dataset files are complete and can be used immediately for other purposes:
- hispanic_first_names.txt
- hispanic_surnames.txt
- hispanic_full_names_huge.txt
- census_hispanic_surnames.txt
- And all other organized datasets
