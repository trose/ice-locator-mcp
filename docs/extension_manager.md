# Extension Manager

The ExtensionManager provides browser extension simulation to make the browser appear more realistic by implementing common extension fingerprints and behaviors.

## Overview

The ExtensionManager is responsible for simulating browser extensions to increase the realism of the browser fingerprint. It provides features such as:

- Simulation of common browser extensions with realistic properties
- Generation of extension fingerprints for browser simulation
- Injection of extension-like JavaScript behavior
- Simulation of realistic extension behavior patterns

## Key Features

### Extension Simulation

The ExtensionManager simulates popular browser extensions including:

- Ad blockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock)
- Grammar checkers (Grammarly)
- Translators (Google Translate)
- Video downloaders
- And many other common extensions

### Extension Fingerprints

The ExtensionManager generates realistic extension fingerprints that mimic:

- Chrome extension APIs (chrome.runtime, chrome.management, etc.)
- Extension manifest data
- Extension permission structures
- Extension storage APIs

### Behavior Simulation

The ExtensionManager simulates realistic extension behavior patterns:

- Content script injection timing
- DOM modification patterns
- API usage patterns
- Background script behavior

## API Reference

### ExtensionProfile

Represents a browser extension with its properties:

- `id`: Extension ID
- `name`: Extension name
- `version`: Extension version
- `description`: Extension description
- `permissions`: List of extension permissions
- `enabled`: Whether the extension is enabled
- `installed_at`: When the extension was installed
- `last_updated`: When the extension was last updated

### ExtensionManager

Main class for managing browser extension simulation:

#### Methods

- `get_random_extensions(count)`: Get a random selection of extensions to simulate
- `generate_extension_fingerprints(extensions)`: Generate realistic extension fingerprints
- `inject_extension_scripts(extensions)`: Generate JavaScript code to inject extension-like behavior
- `simulate_extension_behavior(extensions)`: Generate JavaScript code to simulate realistic extension behavior patterns

## Usage Example

```python
from extension_manager import ExtensionManager, ExtensionProfile

# Create extension manager
extension_manager = ExtensionManager()

# Get random extensions
extensions = extension_manager.get_random_extensions(5)

# Generate extension fingerprints
fingerprints = extension_manager.generate_extension_fingerprints(extensions)

# Inject extension scripts
js_code = await extension_manager.inject_extension_scripts(extensions)

# Simulate extension behavior
behavior_js = await extension_manager.simulate_extension_behavior(extensions)
```

## Integration Points

The ExtensionManager integrates with:

- BrowserSimulator for extension simulation
- AntiDetectionCoordinator for overall anti-detection strategy

## Benefits

- **Improved Realism**: Browser appears more realistic with common extensions
- **Enhanced Evasion**: Extension simulation helps avoid detection
- **Maintained Performance**: Efficient implementation with minimal overhead
- **Resource Efficiency**: Smart extension simulation optimizes browser resources

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- Advanced extension fingerprinting protection
- Cross-extension behavior synchronization
- Extension-specific API simulation
- Integration with browser clustering for distributed extension management
