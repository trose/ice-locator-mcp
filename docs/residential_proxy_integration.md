# Residential Proxy Integration

This document describes the residential proxy integration implemented in the fortified browser approach.

## Overview

Residential proxies are IP addresses provided by real devices and internet service providers (ISPs) rather than data centers. They offer significantly better success rates for web scraping because they appear as legitimate users to target websites, reducing the likelihood of being blocked by anti-bot systems like Akamai Bot Manager.

## Key Features

### 1. Premium Proxy Provider Integration

The system integrates with multiple premium residential proxy providers:

- **BrightData** (formerly BrightData)
- **SmartProxy**
- **NetNut**
- **Oxylabs**
- **GeoSurf**
- **Infatica**
- **Storm Proxies**
- **ScraperAPI**

These providers are configured through environment variables, allowing easy integration without hardcoding credentials.

### 2. Automatic IP Reputation Checking

The system continuously monitors IP reputation to ensure proxies maintain good standing:

- Checks against known residential ISP databases
- Analyzes IP ranges to identify datacenter vs residential IPs
- Maintains reputation scores for each proxy (0-1 scale)
- Automatically removes proxies with poor reputation

### 3. Quality Scoring System

Each proxy is scored based on multiple factors:

- **Success Rate**: Historical success rate of requests
- **Response Time**: Average response time performance
- **Reputation Score**: IP reputation assessment
- **Residential Status**: Bonus for residential proxies
- **Geographic Diversity**: Bonus for geographically diverse IPs
- **Anonymity**: Verification of proxy anonymity
- **Consistency**: Performance consistency over time

### 4. Automatic Rotation

The system automatically rotates proxies based on:

- Configured rotation intervals
- Proxy health status
- Performance metrics
- Request distribution

### 5. Health Monitoring

Continuous health monitoring ensures only reliable proxies are used:

- Basic connectivity testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Anonymity verification
- Geolocation verification
- IP reputation checking

## Implementation Details

### Proxy Configuration

Premium proxy providers are configured through environment variables:

```bash
# BrightData
export BRIGHTDATA_USERNAME="your_username"
export BRIGHTDATA_PASSWORD="your_password"

# SmartProxy
export SMARTPROXY_USERNAME="your_username"
export SMARTPROXY_PASSWORD="your_password"

# NetNut
export NETNUT_USERNAME="your_username"
export NETNUT_PASSWORD="your_password"

# Oxylabs
export OXYLABS_USERNAME="your_username"
export OXYLABS_PASSWORD="your_password"

# GeoSurf
export GEOSURF_TOKEN="your_token"

# Infatica
export INFATICA_KEY="your_key"

# Storm Proxies
export STORM_USERNAME="your_username"
export STORM_PASSWORD="your_password"

# ScraperAPI
export SCRAPERAPI_KEY="your_key"
```

### Proxy Selection Algorithm

The proxy selection algorithm uses a weighted scoring system:

1. **Base Score**: Success rate (0-1 scale)
2. **Residential Bonus**: +0.1 for residential proxies
3. **Reputation Bonus**: Up to +0.2 based on reputation score
4. **Performance Bonus**: Up to +0.2 for faster response times
5. **Load Balancing Penalty**: -0.1 for recently used proxies
6. **Geolocation Bonus**: +0.1 for verified geolocation
7. **Anonymity Bonus**: +0.1 for verified anonymity
8. **Consistency Bonus**: Up to +0.15 for consistent performance

### IP Reputation Checking

The system uses multiple methods to assess IP reputation:

1. **ISP Analysis**: Checks if the ISP is known to be residential
2. **IP Range Analysis**: Determines if IP ranges are typical for residential use
3. **Datacenter Detection**: Identifies known datacenter IP ranges

### Health Monitoring

Health checks include:

1. **Basic Connectivity**: HTTP request to test endpoint
2. **Performance Testing**: Multiple requests to measure response times
3. **Anonymity Verification**: Ensures real IP is hidden
4. **Geolocation Verification**: Confirms proxy location
5. **Reputation Checking**: Continuous IP reputation assessment

## Usage Examples

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are provided in:
- [test_proxy_reputation.py](../tests/test_proxy_reputation.py) - Tests for IP reputation checking
- [test_premium_proxy_integration.py](../tests/test_premium_proxy_integration.py) - Tests for premium proxy provider integration

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Residential Proxies for Critical Requests

Residential proxies should be preferred for accessing the ICE website due to its sophisticated anti-bot measures.

### 2. Monitor Proxy Performance

Regularly check proxy analytics to identify underperforming proxies and adjust configuration accordingly.

### 3. Maintain Geographic Diversity

Use proxies from multiple geographic regions to avoid detection patterns based on location.

### 4. Rotate Proxies Appropriately

Configure rotation intervals based on target website's anti-bot sensitivity.

## Security Considerations

### 1. Credential Management

Never hardcode proxy credentials in source code. Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems.

### 2. Proxy Validation

Always validate proxies before use to ensure they meet performance and security requirements.

### 3. IP Reputation Monitoring

Continuously monitor IP reputation to avoid using proxies that may have been blacklisted.

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Proxy Pool Size

Maintain an adequate proxy pool size to ensure availability during high-demand periods.

### 2. Health Check Intervals

Configure appropriate health check intervals to balance monitoring overhead with proxy reliability.

### 3. Rotation Strategy

Optimize rotation intervals based on success rates and target website behavior.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Low Success Rates

- Check proxy provider credentials
- Verify proxy pool has sufficient residential proxies
- Review IP reputation scores
- Consider adjusting rotation intervals

### 2. High Response Times

- Identify slow-performing proxies
- Check network connectivity to proxy endpoints
- Consider geographic proximity to target servers

### 3. Proxy Pool Exhaustion

- Add more proxy sources
- Adjust health check criteria
- Review failed proxy removal thresholds
